In my last post I [introduced a QUnit to JS Test Driver adapter](/articles/new-qunit-to-js-test-driver-adapter/), a small adapter which converts QUnit tests into native JS Test Driver tests.

This adapter is now part of the JS Test Driver project.

There is now a [QUnit Adapter wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/QUnitAdapter) on the JS Test Driver project site. This will be updated to keep up with any changes to the adapter.

The code is now stored within the JS Test Driver subversion repository. You can always [download the latest version of the QUnit Adapter](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/source/browse/#svn/trunk/JsTestDriver/contrib/qunit) using the Google Code web interface.

Thanks to Jeremie Lenfant-engelmann for deeming QUnit Adapter worthy of official regonition :)
