I'm currently part of the front end team at Geckoboard where we are building an amazing dashboard product.

I'm a JavaScript expert who has developed large scale single page applications for Geckoboard, Qumu, 7digital, and Philips. I've worked across multiple teams, leading teams at my last two companies. I also have experience and passion in Interaction Design and User Experience, advocating heavily for the user. I have over 10 years solid experience coding HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for all browsers (even the shoddy ones). I strongly believe in using tooling to improve the development experience, from storybooks to hot code reloading. I enjoy working with continuous integration and short iterations of improvement and feedback.

I also feel it is important to understand all levels of development, and have ensured I have real work experience in server side development, project management, leading teams, testing, and automating deployment.

I'm interested in moving into contracting as an opportunity to work with more teams to improve both the quality of the software they build and the way in which they build it. I'm passionate about the benefit improved development processes and tooling can make to the quality and speed at which software is built.
