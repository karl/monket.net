I'm a senior software developer with a front end focus.

## Introduction

Iâ€™m a senior developer with over 15 years of experience across a variety of businesses and roles (e.g. team lead, front end, server side, tooling, dev ops).

Iâ€™ve built large web apps in a variety of frameworks and languages (you see a lot come and go in 15 years!). Most recently Iâ€™ve been working with React and TypeScript, a very productive combination. I have lead technology transitions in a sustainable way, helping teams switch to modern tech and practices without slowing down development speed. Iâ€™ve introduced techniques such as state charts to help bring rigour and tame the complexity of UI development.

I've also been a team lead, empowering teams to make excellent technical decisions and helping them grow as individuals. Iâ€™ve reworked hiring processes to help bring in the best team members, and run regular tech discussions to share knowledge and experience and help teams grow. Outside of individual teams Iâ€™ve given a talk at Facebook on the benefits of Storybook as a dev and test tool.

My passion for providing the best user experiences has driven me to work on all levels on the tech stack including server side, tooling, and dev ops. Iâ€™ve built everything from cloud functions running Node to PHP servers with smart caching.  Iâ€™ve even built a custom browser testing framework to support a complex app that spans multiple domains and authentication strategies.

On the tooling side Iâ€™m passionate increasing developer productivity by speeding up feedback loops (using tools like Storybook and hot reloading). My biggest contribution to tooling was probably writing the JSX formatting in Prettier, a tool now used by most teams writing React. If you donâ€™t like how React is formatted now, that is my fault and Iâ€™m sorry ðŸ˜‚

## Projects

**Prettier**, [https://github.com/prettier/prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

A code formatter for JavaScript (and other languages). Prettier is an open source project that I have contributed to. I focused on improving the formatting of JSX.

The improvements I made to JSX formatting in Prettier is probably the most impactful work I've done (in terms of number of people who benefit). Prettier is now used by most teams that use React.

**React Storybook Talk**, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxbQ-cGnoCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxbQ-cGnoCE)

An introduction to React Storybook, what it is, how to use it, and some of the benefits we have seen from adopting it here at Geckoboard.

A talk I gave as part of the React London Meetup at the Facebook offices.

**React Async I/O Testbed**, [https://github.com/karl/react-async-io-testbed](https://github.com/karl/react-async-io-testbed)

This repo attempts to recreate the the IO demo from Dan Abramov's Beyond React 16 talk using the React 16. It shows how to implement suspense style async UI behaviours using React 16.

**Redux Saga State Machine**, [https://redux-saga-state-machine.netlify.com/](https://redux-saga-state-machine.netlify.com/)

A prototype of a library to build a Redux Saga based state machine runner. Built upon xstate and Redux Saga.

This was borne out of some of the work I did while at Sky.

Note I built this before I had experience with TypeScript, it doesn't reflect how I now write TypeScript!

**Dancing Monkeys**, [https://monket.net/dancing-monkeys/](https://monket.net/dancing-monkeys/)

Dancing Monkeys was my individual project while at Imperial College London. It is an application to automatically generate step files for DDR (Dance Dance Revolution)â€¦

Created as part of my final year project at university. Released as open source and maintained for a few years by another developer.
