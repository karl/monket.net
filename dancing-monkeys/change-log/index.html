<p>Current maintainer of Dancing Monkeys: <a href="http://erich.realtimerendering.com/">Eric&nbsp;Haines</a></p>
<p>v1.06 - October 4, 2006 - Fixed “-ons” option so that it actually removes the stops. (Eric&nbsp;Haines)</p>
<p>v1.05 - September 17, 2006 - Added “-x 1” option to hone in on best <span class="caps">BPM</span>. Minor bug fixes. (Eric&nbsp;Haines)</p>
<p>v1.04 - August 18, 2006 - If an embedded image file is found (as used by iTunes), background and banner images are created for the song using this image, unless “-n” option is used. Fixed problem for when “-es” argument is missing (was stopping on 0 stops by default - oops). Fixed problem creating song file if song file name has trailing spaces before the “.mp3” suffix (e.g. “Test song .mp3”). (Eric&nbsp;Haines)</p>
<p>v1.03 - July 28, 2006 - Much faster execution; v1.02 had some compilation flaw. Minor memory savings and documentation changes. (Eric&nbsp;Haines)</p>
<p>v1.02 - July 3, 2006 - Major overhaul of input and output. One code correction to the algorithms used: song length now affects the total number of steps adjusted, so that long songs will have more steps overall. (Eric&nbsp;Haines)</p>
<p>v1.01 - November 3, 2003 - Corrections to output directory parsing. (Karl&nbsp;O’Keeffe)</p>
<p>v1.0 - November 1, 2003 - Original release. (Karl&nbsp;O’Keeffe)</p>
<h2 id="gorilla">Gorilla</h2>

<li>More robust code, e.g. Unicode file names no longer kill the program, they’re ignored instead (sorry, can’t read&nbsp;them).</li>
</ul>
<p>v1.0.0, first official release - September 17, 2006 - Release with v1.05 (David&nbsp;Flink)</p>
<p>From v0.10.7 to v1.0.0:<br>An installer now sets up both programs, desktop icon, etc. Tight integration with Dancing Monkeys, and source for both programs is distributed in the package. Song conversion is now set as a low priority task, so the program can now be run without sucking down all available <span class="caps">CPU</span>. You can stop processing a song partway through and restart later. There is now an estimated time for when processing for a song will finish. The beats per minute gets a slight refinement after it is computed. Songs which are reconverted are done much faster, as the beats per minute value computed earlier for each is reused. Numerous bug&nbsp;fixes.</p>
<p>v0.10.7 - August 18, 2006 - Release with v1.04. (David&nbsp;Flink)</p>
<p>From v0.10.6 to v0.10.7:<br>Fixed Other bug when viewing log in certain circumstances. Renamed background file from background-bg.jpg to background.jpg. Do not overwrite pre-existing background/banner. Fixed bug that caused Gorilla to crash when minimized. Watched output during processing always at left edge. Stopped job list scrolling when clicking “Redo Job”. When loading joblist or returning from early stop, job list is positioned at next to-do job. Stopped songlist from setting current song to top of list when deleting. Forced selected song to remain in the visible part of the songlist when scrolling. Added success and confirm dialog boxes when saving and overwriting, or on exit without save. Corrected handling of “cancel” when saving&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>From v0.10.5 to v0.10.6:<br>Fixed bug when viewing log in certain&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<p>From v0.10.4 to v0.10.5:<br>Abort after current song renamed to Stop after current song. Stop after current song can be canceled with “Don’t Stop” button. dm_log.txt needs to grow before assuming <span class="caps">DM</span> was successful. dm_log.txt now also scanned for “End Time” before assuming DM was successful. Minor change to (eventually) smooth “Wavy Lines”&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>From v0.10.3 to v0.10.4:<br>Added both \bin\win32 and ..\bin\win32 to the <span class="caps">DM</span> search path. Changed DM failure detection to parsing dm_log.txt (old method was based on existence of song directory). Include dm_log.txt in “view log”. Fixed bug where bad config file would lock almost all buttons on the main page. Fixed compatible verion detection when loading job lists. Fixed bug where “,” in any file/directory name would cause Gorilla to think a saved job list was corrupt (without breaking&nbsp;compatability).</p>
<p>From v0.10.2 to v0.10.3:<br>Added rudimentary error handling when reading files. Prevented failure to copy background and banner files from crashing Gorilla. Prevented failure to copy from <span class="caps">SM</span> to DWI from crashing&nbsp;Gorilla.</p>
<p>From v0.10.1 to v0.10.2:<br>Fixed Tab order on Config page. added “Copy Artwork” to use Windows MediaPlayer artwork as song banner (<span class="caps">SM</span>&nbsp;only)</p>
<p>From v0.10.0 to v0.10.1:<br>“<span class="caps">OK</span>&amp;Save” on config screen renamed to a large “OK”. Minor screen layout change. All buttons return focus to job list. Changed wording in “wrong version” prompts. Exit button added. “View Log” button added when a song has been processed. Tab order fixed. Detection of compatible .gor files improved. Fixed minor bug where returning from “GO” didn’t highlight the current song, but buttons still acted on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>From v0.9.4b to v0.10.0:<br>Major code re-write and cleanup. <default> entry removed from song list. Defaults added to configuration screen. Parameters for individual song/directory not shown if it is set to default. Configuration and settings file format changed. Song list font changes to monospace. List maintains songs after processing, showing ok or failed (even if saved). Directories not removed from list when expanded, but flagged —- Ability to “re-process” files (i.e. remove ok/failed flag). Delete on keypress partially added (Only works on keypad. <span class="caps">VB</span>’s fault)-: Added buttons to reload defaults from settings.gor, or to reset defaults to “factory” settings. Delve rejects directories that match DM, SM or DWI&nbsp;directories.</p>
<p>v0.9.4beta - July 25, 2006 - Original release with v1.03. (David&nbsp;Flink)</p>
<p>From v0.9.4a to v0.9.4b:<br>Configure pannel annotated. Directories for DancingMonkeys, StepMania and DanceWithIntensity auto-detected. <default> settings now won’t allow mutually exclusive options. Version of Dancing Monkies auto-detected (Blind accepted v1 not before&nbsp;v1.03)</p>
<p>From v0.9.4 to v0.9.4a:<br>Change screen layout. Added some Tooltips. Prevent window from becomming too narrower or&nbsp;short.</p>
<p>From v0.9.3 to v0.9.4:<br>Spelling more bugs in list handling. created&nbsp;installer</p>
<p>From 0.9.2 to v0.9.3:<br>Fixed bug when returning from busy screen to main pannel Removed rchtxt32.ocx dependancy Added <span class="caps">OLE</span> Drag-and-drop to job list. Improved directory selection&nbsp;pannel.</p>
<p>From v0.9.1b to v0.9.2:<br>Correct defaults restored after job completion/abort. Spelling. <span class="caps">DM</span> logs now all named and placed in <DancingMonkeys>\Output. Directories not created for failed stepfile generation. Added&nbsp;icon.</p>
<p>From v0.9.1 to v0.9.1b:<br>Unexpected directory change&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>From v0.9 to v0.9.1:<br>“Abort” on config page renamed to “Close”. Directory processing&nbsp;corrected.</p>
